# Python Exercises 3 - Loops

## For Loop Exercises (1-3)

### Exercise 1: Basic For Loop
Create a list of five fruits. Use a `for` loop to print each fruit in the list.

### Exercise 2: String Iteration
Ask the user to input their name. Use a `for` loop to print each character of their name on a separate line.  

**Hint:** Use the `input()` function to get the user's name.

### Exercise 3: Range Function
Ask the user for a number between **1 and 10**. Use a `for` loop with the `range()` function to print the square of each number from **1 up to the user's input number**.  

**Hint:** Use the `input()` function and convert the input to an integer.

## While Loop Exercises (4-6)

### Exercise 4: Basic While Loop
Ask the user for a **starting number**. Use a `while` loop to print the value and **decrease it by 1** until it reaches **0**.  

**Hint:** Use the `input()` function and convert the input to an integer.

### Exercise 5: Input Validation
Use a `while` loop to **repeatedly** ask the user for a **positive number**. Continue asking **until they enter a positive number**, then print `"Thank you!"`.  

**Hint:** You'll need to use the `input()` function and convert the input to an integer.

### Exercise 6: Loop with `break` and `continue`
Create a `while` loop that **generates random numbers between 1 and 10** (use the `random` module).  

- If the number is **7**, `break` out of the loop.  
- If the number is **even**, `continue` to skip it and move to the next iteration.  
- Print only the **odd numbers** (except **7**).  

**Hint:** Use `random.randint()` and the `break` and `continue` statements.
